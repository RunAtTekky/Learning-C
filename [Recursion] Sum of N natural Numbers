//Let's create a program which gives sum of two n Natural Numbers using recursion
int nSum(int n){
    // First we will declare a variable
    int sum;

    // Now we will create a loop which uses recursion
    if (n != 0)
    // This states if n is NOT 0
    {
        // Then the function should return the value n plus nSum(n-1)
        return n + nSum(n-1);   
        // But here we have the same function inside a function
        // So first we will have to go through this function and we will go back to the top again with n-1 as value
        // Again if n is NOT 0 we will follow the same steps of recalling the function

    }
    // However if n is EQUAL to 0
    else{
        // Then we will return the same value i.e. if n is ZERO then it will return 0
        return n;
    }
    // Now this value is returned to the function as value of nSum(0)
    // Then this value goes inside the recalling function which in this case will be nSum(1-1) 
    // It will again get returned and then it will follow along
    // Finally all the values will be added up again and we will get our desired answer


}
// This is the function which will be read
int main(){
    // variable declaration
    int entNum;

    // Take input from the user
    printf("Write the number upto which you want to find SUM:\n");
    scanf("%d", &entNum);

    // Give the desired output
    printf("The sum of numbers upto %d is %d", entNum, nSum(entNum));
